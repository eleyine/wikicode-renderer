Python script

1. Obtain .html formatted Google Doc with File/Download as../HTML
2. Run wikicode.py
3. You will be prompted for the .html input file and the .txt output file to be created

STATUS: 
* Works for very simple Google Docs e.g. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P63dmJHDk_35OVpix5Cd8zHxKaMmi_8Bo9o7Pdkm6M0/edit?hl=en&authkey=CMyc-aYF#

TODO:
* Bolden text
* Figure a more elegant way to format lists. List items of degree 4 have the same class as list items of degree 1. As a result, the output is the same. There should be a way to keep of track of the depth of the list.
* Insert a filter option that could for example remove headers and footers from Open Courses Google Notes

PROJECT: 
* Create a web app that takes the url of the google doc and outputs the wikicode format
* Convert it to Java?
